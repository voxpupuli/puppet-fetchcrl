This is the fetchcrl module it configures fetch-crl version 3 where
ever it can.

[Fetchcrl](http://wiki.nikhef.nl/grid/FetchCRL3) utility will retrieve certificate
revocation lists (CRLs) for a set of installed trust anchors, based on crl_url files
or IGTF-style info files.

This module obsoletes [CernOps-fetchcrl-1.1.0](https://forge.puppet.com/CERNOps/fetchcrl)

## Examples

```puppet
class{'fetchcrl':
  http_proxy            => 'http:://squid.example.org:8000',
  carepo                => 'http://yum.example.org/yumrepo',
  cache_control_request => '3600',
}

fetchcrl::ca{'EDG-Tutorial-CA':
 agingtolerance => 168,
 comment        => 'Increased as unreliable',
}
```

## Facts

Two custom facts are included.

*certissuer* returns the issuer of a grid certificate located at
/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem if it exists.
*trustedca*  returns an array of all the certificate authoriry subjects located
at /etc/grid-security/*.pem
